# WebGL Deployment of Unity Project

This repository hosts a **Unity WebGL build** of my Rubik's Cube simulation. The project has been exported from Unity as a WebGL application and deployed on a web server for interactive access.

### Access the live demo here: [Live WebGL Build](https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/)

To deploy a Unity WebGL project:
1. Build the Unity project using the **WebGL** build target.
2. Upload the build folder to your repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages from the repository's settings.
